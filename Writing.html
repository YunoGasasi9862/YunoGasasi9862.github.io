               <p class="content">
            The ship throttled down, sporadically, in the vicinity of the Virgo cluster. This cluster was renowned for housing around 1400 galaxies. 
            Amun77, the survivor of the 2nd Android war, was charting new points of 
            interest into the already existing repertoire of the Virgo cluster. Both the android wars happened due to a single reason: the elixir of life. It was a veil so crucial to androids for seamless functioning. The elixir was like water to androids; without it, they would cease to exist. However, the reservoir eventually depleted, stripping the androids of the luxury of having the vials on a daily basis to weekly. The current situation was no different. Thus, each android was tasked to scour the mystic clusters and come across findings worth crediting the elixirs. 
            Amun77 was an android that was quite different in appearance. His 
            skin had a rich walnut texture that blended profoundly with his facial
            features. His eyes had a semblance to the deep azure waters of the world: 
            ethereal and pure. He was slender in figure with ebony black curls cascading 
            down to his shoulders. And he walked quite mechanically, as expected from mechanized 
            humans. Nonetheless, Amun77 was mesmerizing from every angle. Even his intelligence spoke 
            volumes of his internal beauty. Apparently, he was a crossbreed between an android and a 
            human. No one knew if it was a lie or a truth, but the majority conceded unwillingly.
