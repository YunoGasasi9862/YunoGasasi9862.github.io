                Color Switch Clone is an inspired game which takes on the footsteps of the acclaimed title <span>"Color Switch"</span> available on both Google and Apple Store.
                Some of the mechanisms are changed. Nonetheless, the idea remains the same: matching the color of the ball with that of the rotating ring. Also, it's the watered down version of the actual title, 
                so alot of the enviormental elements were degraded/stripped due to the lack of available resources. However, it entails the same essence and is fun to play.

              Initially, i thought to recreate Angry birds with the same game mechanics, but i dont know at point in time of development it turned to Angry Fish.
              <span>Angry Fish</span> is a game that is based off on the same foundation of Angry Birds. The only difference is the characters and the enviornment the game thrives in.

            <span>Box Runner</span> was the first ever Unity game i developed. I was following Brackey's toturial on Youtube and was all over the sky when i had this epiphany that the 
            game industry is a place i want to be in. Well, Box runner is an endless runner title. All it requires of you to skip the blocks, slide east and west, and keep running until your hands ache from hopping and slithering.

               <span>Kiwi Eater</span> is my second 2D but first platformer game that i created. It's a two level based game where the main character 
                has to collect kiwis (I love Kiwis), all the while protecting itself from the booby traps including spikes and moving saws.
               The whole process of developing <span>Kiwi Eater</span> gave me an immense closure into the world of 2D platformer and im still in awe.

               <span>Figher Planes</span> is the game that i cloned by watching one of the toturials on the Youtube. This game is all about taking sweet, deadly turns from the missles and an enemy airplane.
                I love the mechanics of the Figher planes because it extensivley makes use of genial and soft turns which is something that still never fails to amaze me.
